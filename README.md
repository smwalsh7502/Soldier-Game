# Soldier Game

## Purpose
A dungeon and dragons inspired text-based adventure game to practice object oriented programming and passing by pointer.

## Description
This game uses mechanics similarly of those used in dungeons and dragons. A character class was created with "getters" and "setters" which can be used to create the "enemy" character. We also practiced passing by reference and by pointer as well as proper coding documentation and formatting.
