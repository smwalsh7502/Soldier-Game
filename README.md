# Soldier Game

## Purpose
In my Programming II class, our professor assigned that each student create a dungeon and dragons text-based adventure game to practice object oriented programming.

## Description
This game uses mechanics of that similarly used in dungeons and dragons. A character class was created with "getters" and "setters" which can be used to create the "enemy" character. We also practiced passing by reference and by pointer as well as proper coding documentation and formatting.
